This is my tutorial from the Sitepoint book "Build mobile websites and apps for smart devices"; By Earle Castledine, Myles Eftos, and Max Wheeler.

As I was working with just the html and css, I wanted to be able to actually add the items and make it more real as I went through
the book. 


It will be a work in progress I move through the book.
